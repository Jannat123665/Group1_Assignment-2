# Group1_Assignment-2 Brief
In Assignment 2, the main topics we learn are:
1)	Generating 2D splines: We use a space-filling curve to get a loop. Then multiple points are made all along the curve which is called Sampling. These various points when joined together create a loop which is the glider’s path. Then we decide the area for the path and at the end, we set the position away from the landscape to avoid overlaps.
2)	Spline rendering and Animation: Animation is created to show the glider's movement over the path.
3)	Setting the camera: The camera goes along with the glider to get the glider’s movement over the path.
Overall, this assignment teaches us important concepts which include generating 2D splines, spline rendering, and animation, and setting the camera. The animation of the glider’s movement along the path a realistic effect. This assignment gives us an experience of 3d animation and developing games.
